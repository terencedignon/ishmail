# Ishmail

Ishmail is a web application inspired by Gmail, built using Ruby on Rails and React.js. Ishmail aims to provide Gmail's core functionality in a minimalist build.

At the moment users can send email in-house, safe drafts, and mark messages as read, starred, important, spam, or archived.   Contacts are added as emails are sent to new addresses, and both contacts and emails are searchable.  Users can also receive mail from the outside, and will soon be able to send to all addresses. By the middle of February users should be able to engage in multithreaded messages, chat with one another, and communicate with addresses that are out of network.
